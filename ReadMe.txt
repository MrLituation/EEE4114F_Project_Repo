Original creator of data database:
https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sagyamthapa/handwritten-math-symbols/code

Testing:

Be sure to move images in TestImages to be inside the data or dataCustom folder depending on which database is used or change the directory in code.

DataSet:

The numbers and symbols have been separated into two different folders although they need to be in one folder named data>dataset. Therefore, be sure to combine dataNumbers and dataSymbols accordingly before running code. This was done because GitHub has a 25mb limit.
